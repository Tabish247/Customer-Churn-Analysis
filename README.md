##Churn Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

#Project Objective
The objective of this project is to identify the key drivers of customer churn, understand who is most likely to leave, and uncover actionable insights to help reduce churn. The dashboard supports data-backed customer retention strategies.

#Dataset Used
The dataset includes:
- Demographics: Gender, Age group
- Account Information: Contract type, tenure, payment method
- Services Used: Internet type, phone & streaming services, security & backup
- Geographic Information: State/Region
- Churn Label and New Joiners

#Business Questions Answered
- What is the overall churn rate?
- Which genders and age groups churn the most?
- Which states have the highest churn?
- How do contract type, payment method, and tenure affect churn?
- Which internet and value‑added services have high churn?
- What are the major churn reasons?

#Process & Methodology
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Transformation (tenure buckets, age groups, churn %)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Power BI Dashboard Development using DAX measures

#Key Insights
- Overall churn rate is 27%
- Age >50 shows highest churn (31.6%)
- Monthly contracts have 46.5% churn
- Fiber Optic customers churn at 41.1%
- Tenure <12 months has the highest churn
- Mailed checks & bank withdrawals show highest payment-related churn
- J&K (57%) and Assam (38%) have the highest state‑level churn
- Top churn reasons: Competition (761), Dissatisfaction (300+), Price (196)

#Final Conclusion
Churn is strongly driven by contract flexibility, early-tenure dissatisfaction, payment friction, and internet service issues. The company should:
- Promote long‑term contracts
- Improve service quality, especially Fiber Optic
- Simplify payment options
- Target customers within first 12 months
- Strengthen retention in high‑churn regions
